#! scopes: we can only access a variable within a function and not out of it
# if we declare a variable outside a function, we can print it within the function. 
# the variable declared out of a function are called global variables while those within a function are called local variables.
# we can provide the variables within the function as well as we call call them when running the function
# e.x def func(name, age)
